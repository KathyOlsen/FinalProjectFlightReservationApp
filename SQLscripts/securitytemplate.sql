create database newproject;
use newproject;

-- For each new program:
-- (1) copy and paste the above code into a new scripts page in mySQL Workbench,
-- (2) save that page with a name for your new program (not 'newproject'),
-- (3) replace 'newproject' in the code you copied from above with a name befitting your new program
-- (3) run the code in mySQL Workbench to create the database,
-- (4) leave mySQL Workbench open and running while you are running the program in IntelliJ,
-- (5) VITAL - modify application.properties so that the url refers to what you named your SQL file instead of to 'newproject'
